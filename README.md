### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leo, a aspiring software engineer. I'm from the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area. I enjoy using my programming skills in Javascript, React, Java, and Python to make games. I am interested in web development, but I am open to opportunities across the field. I am a fast learner and enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks through hands-on experimentation.
